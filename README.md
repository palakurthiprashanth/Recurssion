# Recurssion

Function calling a function

## Format

1. Base condition , where recursive calls will stop if base condition is true
2. Recursive calls if BAse condition is false

## Memory Allocation in Recursion

When function is called memory is allocated in stack , LIFO.

## Memory Allocation of Recursive Functions

A different copy of local variables is created for each function call. When the base case is reached, the child function returns its value to the function from which it was called. Then, this child functionâ€™s stack frame is removed. This process continues until the parent function is returned.

## Types of recursion

1. Direct Recursion

  If a function calling itself in same function , it is direct recursion.
  ```javascript
      function function1(p1, p2, ..., pn) {
      // Some code here
      function1(p1, p2, ..., pn);
      // Some code here
    }
```

## Printing Natural Numbers from 1 to n Using Direct Recursion

```javascript
function printNumbers(lowrange, highrange) {
  //Base condition
  if (lowrange > highrange) {
    return;
  }
  console.log(lowrange);
  printNumbers(lowrange + 1, highrange);
}

```
2. Indirect Recursion

Occurs when Function calls another function, and another function called intial function again.

```javascript
function p1() {
  function p2();
}
function p2(){
  function p1();
}
```

```javascript
function printNumbers(lowrange, highrange) {
  if (lowrange <= highrange) {
    console.log(lowrange);
    lowrange = lowrange + 1;
    helperPrint(lowrange, highrange);
  } else {
    return;
  }
}

function helperPrint(lowrange, highrange) {
  if (lowrange <= highrange) {
    console.log(lowrange);
    lowrange = lowrange + 1;
    printNumbers(lowrange, highrange);
  } else {
    return;
  }
}
printNumbers(1, 5);

```
